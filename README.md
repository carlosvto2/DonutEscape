# DonutEscape

This repo contains all the code to create the next game:

Roguelike game created in a two weeks Game Jam with Unreal Engine 5. In this game the player is a donut that is trapped in the middle of a dungeon and needs to find a way out.

The game starts in a room and all the rooms around will be randomly generated, meaning that the dungeon will be different every time the game is played. In each room the enemies are also randomly generated every time the player enters unless he kills them all.

To fight the enemies the donut can throw fireballs and use some bombs that can be found as loot. There are also other pickups to help the player:
- Shield pickup: increases the player´s shield partially
- Health pickup: increases the player´s health partially
- Multiple shoot: gives the player the ability to throw two fireballs instead of one

There are also random blue blocks in the game that can be used when the player is not full health, and they recovers the player´s health, but also rotates the dungeon, so that everytime the player interacts with them the dungeon will look different. That could make a little bit harder for the player to know which rooms he already visited and which not.
